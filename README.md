Used Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the resale price of used cars using Machine Learning (XGBoost Regressor). The model is trained on a dataset containing car features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more, allowing it to predict a carâ€™s value with high accuracy. The entire workflow is implemented in Google Colab.

ðŸš€ Features

Predicts resale prices of used cars from multiple features

Uses XGBoost Regressor for high accuracy predictions

Handles both categorical and numerical car features

Easy to run in Colab without local setup

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

Brand / Make

Year of manufacture

Mileage

Fuel type

Transmission type

Engine size

Other relevant car attributes

Make sure to upload the dataset (used_cars.csv) to Colab before running the notebook.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python
